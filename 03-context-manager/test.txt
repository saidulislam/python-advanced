This code works in much the same way as Linux’s tail program does. 
Here we pass in a filename to our script along with the n number of 
lines we want to return. The deque is bounded to whatever number we 
pass in as n. This means that once the deque is full, when new lines 
are read in and added to the deque, older lines are popped off the 
other end and discarded. We also wrapped the file opening with 
statement in a simple exception handler because it’s really easy 
to pass in a malformed path. This will catch files that don’t exist 
for example.
